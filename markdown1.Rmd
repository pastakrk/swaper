## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
$$Price_{ask} = (\frac{base}{quote})_{ask}$$
$$Price_{bid} = (\frac{base}{quote})_{bid}$$


$$Short=Price_{bid}*(\frac{1+\frac{(Rate_{bid}^{quote}-\frac{markup}{2})}{360}}{1+\frac{(Rate_{ask}^{base}+\frac{markup}{2})}{360}}-1) $$
$$Long=Price_{ask}*(1-\frac{1+\frac{(Rate_{ask}^{quote}+\frac{markup}{2})}{360}}{1+\frac{(Rate_{bid}^{base}-\frac{markup}{2})}{360}}) $$
